üìò Overview

The Vehicle Insurance Management System (VIS) is a web-based platform that enables customers to apply for vehicle insurance, upload proofs, and track their policy status online.
Developed as part of a Cognizant (CTS) internship project, the system was built by a team where I primarily handled backend development, while collaborating with teammates for frontend integration.

For detailed UI flow and operations, refer to the [User Manual (High-Level PDF)] available in the repository.

üß† Objective

To create a digital interface that:

Simplifies insurance application and approval workflows.
